# Dynamic Programming

## Description

Practice problems to help me with a better understanding of how dynamic programming principles can greatly reduce the workload that a computer needs to handle in order to find solutions to given problems. Working through these problems also helps me gain a better understanding of time and space complexity and how to calucalte the change in each when memoization is implemented.

## Memoization Best Practices

* 1: Make it work. Get a working solution even at the cost of time
* 2: Visualize the problem as a tree 
* 3: Implement the tree in the function using recursion
* 4: Test the brute force recurstion solution
* 5: Begin to make the solution more efficient
* 6: Add a memo object to the function and include it in all recursive calls
* 7: Add memo fetching logic with a base case to return its value
* 8: Store the return values in the memo object after each recursion
